This script takes care of managing users
on a system. 

Running deploy.py will create the user,
place its SSH keyfile in the homedir and set
all permissions and ownership correctly.

It will remove existing users that aren't
present in the SSH keys file.

Edit ssh-keys-file and review deploy.py
then simply run:

$ python deploy.py
